UCI HAR Dataset Avg dataset
===========================
This dataset is a condensation of the UCI HAR dataset (referred to below
as "the original data"), derived as follows:

- The test and training datasets in the original data have been combined.

- In the original data, the subject-ID, activity-ID and activity-name
are contained in separate files.  In this dataset, they are combined with
the corresponding measurement data and are present in the first three
columns.

- Only the MEAN and STD measurements are retained.  These consist of the
columns in the original data whose names contain the strings "mean()" and
"std()", respectively.

- The data has been summarized so that there is one record per subject, per
activity.  The multiple measurement records in the original data have been
averaged over the subject and activity.  The string "-avg" has been appended
to the original measurement names to reflect this.


This dataset contains the following columns, in left-to-right order:

 [1] "activity_id"
    The internal-ID for the activity that the subject was performing when
    the measurements in the record were recorded.  These IDs originate
    from the "y_train.txt" and "y_test.txt" files in the original data,
    which are the activity label files for the measurement data files.

 [2] "activity_name"
    A text name for the activity given by the activity-ID in the previous
    column.  Derived by using the activity-ID to look up the text name
    in the "activity_labels.txt" file in the original data.

 [3] "subject_id"
    The ID of the subject who performed the activity and whose measurements
    are contained in the record.  These subject-IDs were imported from the
    "subject_train.txt" and "subject_test.txt" files in the original data.


The remaining columns are the MEAN and STD measurements from the original
data, averaged over the particular combination of subject-ID and activity-ID
that each record in this dataset represents.

For more information on the data contained in the columns, see the 
file "features_info.txt" in the original data.  That file contains
information on the original, unaveraged, columns.  Information for
each column "XYZ-avg" below can be found by looking in that file for
information on the original "XYZ" column.
